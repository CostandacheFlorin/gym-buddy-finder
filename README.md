# Description
This is the frontend repository for my Gym Buddy Finder app. Here I will describe all the functionalities of my app, also you can check out my code.
This app aims to help individuals find new people they can workout with, and even start friendships outside the gym, as you can set up your profile with hobbies outside of the gym room aswell.
Users can set up their profiles, browse people and once they match with someone, they can send a DM to them.

* Browse people

 You can browse people by clicking the browse tab inside the top navigation. For now you can only browse people with the same gender as you ( for obvious reasons).

Here are four actions you can take: go to the previous person, reject, match, or go to the next person.

The matching algorithm is made in a way so the people that want to match with you are the first ones appearing, this facilitating creating connections easier.

After you succesfully matched with someone, a pop up will be displayed and you can start messaging them.

The messages are being sent / received in real time via WebSockets, so the information is in realtime.
